# 🧠 Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow

This repository contains my personal learning journey through the book **“Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow”** by *Aurélien Géron*.
I’m documenting my progress chapter by chapter — including all notebooks, code experiments, notes, and key takeaways — as I build a solid foundation in Machine Learning and Deep Learning.

---

## 📚 Current Progress

* **Chapter 1:** The Machine Learning Landscape (I will share the notes soon)
* **Chapter 2:** End-to-End Machine Learning Project *(Currently learning)*
* *(More chapters coming soon as I continue learning daily!)*
