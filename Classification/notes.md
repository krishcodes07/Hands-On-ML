# Classification

### What is Classification
- Classification in machine learning is a supervised learning technique where a model is trained on labeled data to predict discrete class labels for new, unseen data points.
It involves identifying patterns and relationships between input features (such as color, shape, or text) and predefined output categories (like "spam" or "not spam", "cat" or "dog")

- The goal is to assign each input to one of several predefined classes based on its characteristics, and the model learns this mapping function from the training data.
 Common applications include spam detection, image recognition, and medical diagnosis

 ### Dataset
- In this chapter we will be using the famous MNIST dataset, which is a set of 70,000 small
images of digits handwritten by high school students and employees of the US Census Bureau.Each image is labeled with the digit it represents.

- This set has been studied so much that it is often called the “hello world” of Machine Learning: whenever people come up with a new classification algorithm they are curious to see how it will perform on MNIST, and anyone who learns Machine Learning tackles this dataset sooner or later
